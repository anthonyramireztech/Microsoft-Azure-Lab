**IN PROGRESS**


I have created a Micosoft Azure home lab containing a windows 2019 server, and a windows 10 pro system. This lab is in the works so there is more to come but here are some screenshots documenting my progress.

Added new users through powershell using specific commands. As you can see i've created three new users with the names Billy, Jose, and Jimmy. (This process can also be done through the GUI but I wanted to utilize powershell).
